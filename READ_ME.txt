      Every 107 seconds an American is sexually assaulted. Sexual assault is an issue that affects both men and women all over the world. Due to the speedy and intimidating nature of the crime, in most cases the victim is rendered helpless. Often, the victim does not have the ability to reach out for his/her phone and call for help. “Safe” aims to counter the problem in a short and simple way; a discreet wearable concealed within a piece of jewelry that, when triggered, sends an emergency call to 911.       “Safe” has two major components: a microcontroller and an Android app. “Safe” is built using a tiny microcontroller, the ESPToy. The small and hidden button on the ESPToy allows the user to press the button without attracting unwanted attention. The Android app itself has a basic interface, allowing the user to change the settings from sending a call to the domestic violence hotline or to the number of a chosen family member or friend.  The app, built in Eclipse is coded using Java.        To run this app, please download the Android package for Eclipse. For more information about how to do this, please follow this link: http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/installing-adt.html. An apk file is also included in the submission, so another option is to install that on an Android device and run the app. A documentation of our errors is found in another file in the final submission folder.
